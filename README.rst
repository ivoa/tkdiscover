tkdiscover.py
=============

This is a demonstration of pyVO's global dataset discovery
functionality.  It lets you define a region in space, time, and spectrum
and then runs the pyvo query, reporting on its progress.  You can
save the current result into VOTables at any time.

To make this work, at this time (2024-02-15) you need absolute
bleeding-edge pyvo: PR#470.
